>Welcome to the Repo for CityScape! Bro, if you're reading this, then I dont have a lot to tell you about what's going on other then a brief summary. CityScape is a basic turn based city building game in javascript. Grok the code yourself for a better understanding of what's going on, it's all pretty straight forward so far.

>ChangeLog 6/24:
  Added Wood, Stone, Iron and Steel costs to most buildings. Began work on GUI (see gui.js): GUI now displays current resource count, GUI now displays current Protections count, GUI now displays list of workers, GUI now displays owned buildings. Stalled work on controller functions until I get a better idea of how to best proceed. Nested more UL's into index.html for GUI. Commented my work on controller.js.
